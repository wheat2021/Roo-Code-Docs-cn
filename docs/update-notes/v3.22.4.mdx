# Roo Code 3.22.4 Release Notes (2025-06-27)

This patch release improves workflow efficiency and fixes critical bugs affecting task sharing and Claude Code provider reliability.

## QOL Improvements

* **Mode Switching**: Follow-up question suggestions can now switch modes directly, eliminating the need to manually change modes after selecting a suggestion ([#5200](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5200))

## Bug Fixes

* **Task Sharing**: Fixed share button popover not opening when clicked - now works properly while maintaining tooltip functionality ([#5203](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5203))
* **Claude Code Reliability**: Fixed hanging and failures when working with large conversation histories on Linux and Code-Server environments by implementing stdin streaming instead of command-line arguments (thanks Fovty, edgan, flyguy7299!) ([#5186](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5186))
