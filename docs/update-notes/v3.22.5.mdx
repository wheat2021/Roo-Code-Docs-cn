# Roo Code 3.22.5 Release Notes (2025-06-29)

This patch release removes the Gemini CLI provider and fixes several internal telemetry issues.

## Provider Updates

* **Gemini CLI Removal**: The Gemini CLI provider has been removed per Google's request for a more standard implementation. Users previously using the Gemini CLI provider should migrate to the standard Gemini provider for continued access to Gemini models ([#5223](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5223))

## Bug Fixes

* **Repository URL Handling**: Fixed telemetry functionality to properly handle git repository URLs by automatically converting SSH URLs to HTTPS format, ensuring telemetry works correctly regardless of which URL format users have configured ([#5202](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5202)) (thanks liwilliam2021!)
* **Cloud Telemetry**: Fixed cloud telemetry capture for assistant messages that was accidentally broken by a previous optimization ([#5220](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5220))
* **Internal Telemetry**: Improved internal telemetry system to prevent duplicate event capturing, enhancing data accuracy and system efficiency ([#5211](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5211))
* **Type Error Prevention**: Fixed internal type errors when the gemini-cli provider is removed, ensuring smoother operation ([#5226](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5226))
