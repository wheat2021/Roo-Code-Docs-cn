We've added support for [Google's latest Gemini 2.5 models](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-model-family-expands/) ([#4762](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4762), [#4770](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4770), [#4767](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4767)):

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Enhanced capabilities for complex coding tasks
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Fast model with improved performance
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**: Lightweight model perfect for quick tasks

These new models bring enhanced reasoning capabilities and better performance across various coding tasks.

## Excel File Support

Added support for reading Excel (.xlsx) files in tools ([#4751](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4751)). You can now:

- **Read Excel Files**: Directly analyze and work with Excel spreadsheets
- **Extract Data**: Access cell values, formulas, and sheet information
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with all existing Roo Code tools and features

## New Features

* **LaTeX Rendering**: You can now render LaTeX math equations directly in the chat window (thanks ColbySerpa!) ([#4786](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4786))
* **MCP Tool Toggle**: A new toggle allows you to disable individual MCP server tools from being included in the prompt context (thanks Rexarrior!) ([#3551](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/3551))

## QOL Improvements

*   **Profile-Specific Context Thresholds**: You can now configure different intelligent context condensing thresholds for each of your API configuration profiles. This gives you more granular control over context management, which is especially useful when working with multiple models that have different context window sizes (thanks SannidhyaSah, SirBadfish!) ([#4456](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4456)).
