## Sharing from within Roo Code

### Step 1: Access the Share Option

In any active task view, locate the **link icon** <Codicon name="link" /> on the right side of the task header.

This option allows anyone with the link to access your task.

### Step 3: Link Created

The system will generate a public link and automatically copy it to your clipboard.

You can now share this link with team members, collaborators, or anyone who needs access to view your task and its conversation history.

## Sharing from Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Task in Dashboard

Navigate to your [Roo Code Cloud dashboard](/roo-code-cloud/dashboard) and click on the task you want to share to open the detailed task modal.

### Step 2: Open Share Modal

Within the detailed task modal, click the **Share** button to open the sharing options.

The modal will show options to create a public link that anyone can access, with a note that links expire in 30 days.

### Step 3: Create and Manage Share Links

Click **Create Share Link** to generate a new public link. Once created, you'll see the confirmation screen:

<img src="/img/task-sharing/task-sharing-5.png" alt="Share link created confirmation" width="600" />

From this screen you can:
- **Copy Link** - Copy the generated share link to your clipboard
- **Create Another Link** - Generate additional share links for the same task
- **View Previous Links** - See and manage previously created links for this task
- **Delete Links** - Remove share links using the delete icon

The dashboard sharing method provides more advanced link management capabilities, including the ability to create multiple links per task and track previously generated links.
