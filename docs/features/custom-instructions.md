# Custom Instructions

Custom Instructions allow you to personalize how Roo behaves, providing specific guidance that shapes responses, coding style, and decision-making processes.

:::info Instruction File Locations
You can provide custom instructions using global rules (applied across all projects), workspace rules (project-specific), or through the Prompts tab interface.

**Global Rules Directory:** Apply to all projects automatically.
*   **Linux/macOS:** `~/.roo/rules/` and `~/.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/`
*   **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.roo\rules\` and `%USERPROFILE%\.roo\rules-{modeSlug}\`

**Workspace Rules:** Apply only to the current project, can override global rules.
*   **Preferred Method: Directory (`.roo/rules/`)**
    ```
    .
    ├── .roo/
    │   └── rules/          # Workspace-wide rules
    │       ├── 01-general.md
    │       └── 02-coding-style.txt
    └── ... (other project files)
    ```
*   **Fallback Method: Single File (`.roorules`)**
    ```
    .
    ├── .roorules           # Workspace-wide rules (single file)
    └── ... (other project files)
    ```

**Mode-Specific Instructions:** Apply only to a specific mode (e.g., `code`).
*   **Preferred Method: Directory (`.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/`)**
    ```
    .
    ├── .roo/
    │   └── rules-code/     # Rules for "code" mode
    │       ├── 01-js-style.md
    │       └── 02-ts-style.md
    └── ... (other project files)
    ```
*   **Fallback Method: Single File (`.roorules-{modeSlug}`)**
    ```
    .
    ├── .roorules-code      # Rules for "code" mode (single file)
    └── ... (other project files)
    ```

Rules are loaded in order: Global rules first, then workspace rules (which can override global rules). See [Global Rules Directory](#global-rules-directory) for details.

## What Are Custom Instructions?

Custom Instructions define specific behaviors, preferences, and constraints beyond Roo's basic role definition. Examples include coding style, documentation standards, testing requirements, and workflow guidelines.

---

## Setting Custom Instructions

### Global Custom Instructions

These instructions apply across all workspaces and maintain your preferences regardless of which project you're working on.

**How to set them:**

<img src="/img/custom-instructions/custom-instructions.png" alt="Roo Code Prompts tab showing global custom instructions interface" width="600" />
1.  **Open Prompts Tab:** Click the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar
2.  **Find Section:** Find the "Custom Instructions for All Modes" section
3.  **Enter Instructions:** Enter your instructions in the text area
4.  **Save Changes:** Click "Done" to save your changes

### Global Rules Directory

The Global Rules Directory feature provides reusable rules and custom instructions that automatically apply across all your projects. This system supports both global configurations and project-specific overrides.

#### Key Benefits

**Without Global Rules**: You had to maintain separate rule files in each project:
- Copy the same rules to every new project
- Update rules manually across multiple projects
- No consistency between projects

**With Global Rules**: Create rules once and use them everywhere:
- Set up your preferred coding standards globally
- Override specific rules per project when needed
- Maintain consistency across all your work
- Easy to update rules for all projects at once

#### Directory Structure

The global rules directory location is fixed and cannot be customized:

**Linux/macOS:**
```
~/.roo/                           # Your global Roo configuration
├── rules/                        # General rules applied to all projects
│   ├── coding-standards.md
│   ├── formatting-rules.md
│   └── security-guidelines.md
├── rules-code/                   # Rules specific to Code mode
│   ├── typescript-rules.md
│   └── testing-requirements.md
├── rules-docs-extractor/         # Rules for documentation extraction
│   └── documentation-style.md
└── rules-{mode}/                 # Rules for other specific modes
    └── mode-specific-rules.md
```

**Windows:**
```
%USERPROFILE%\.roo\               # Your global Roo configuration
├── rules\                        # General rules applied to all projects
│   ├── coding-standards.md
│   ├── formatting-rules.md
│   └── security-guidelines.md
├── rules-code\                   # Rules specific to Code mode
│   ├── typescript-rules.md
│   └── testing-requirements.md
└── rules-{mode}\                 # Rules for other specific modes
    └── mode-specific-rules.md
```

#### Setting Up Global Rules

1. **Create Global Rules Directory:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   mkdir -p ~/.roo/rules
   
   # Windows
   mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.roo\rules
   ```

2. **Add General Rules** (`~/.roo/rules/coding-standards.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Global Coding Standards
   
   1. Always use TypeScript for new projects
   2. Write unit tests for all new functions
   3. Use descriptive variable names
   4. Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
   ```

3. **Add Mode-Specific Rules** (`~/.roo/rules-code/typescript-rules.md`):
   ```markdown
   # TypeScript Code Mode Rules
   
   1. Use strict mode in tsconfig.json
   2. Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
   3. Always specify return types for functions
   ```

#### Available Rule Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `rules/` | General rules applied to all modes |
| `rules-code/` | Rules specific to Code mode |
| `rules-docs-extractor/` | Rules for documentation extraction |
| `rules-architect/` | Rules for system architecture tasks |
| `rules-debug/` | Rules for debugging workflows |
| `rules-{mode}/` | Rules for any custom mode |

#### Rule Loading Order

Rules are loaded in this order:

1. **Global Rules** (from `~/.roo/`)
2. **Project Rules** (from `project/.roo/`) - can override global rules
3. **Legacy Files** (`.roorules`, `.clinerules` - for backward compatibility)

Within each level, mode-specific rules are loaded before general rules.

### Workspace-Level Instructions

These instructions only apply within your current workspace, allowing you to customize Roo Code's behavior for specific projects.

#### Workspace-Wide Instructions via Files/Directories

Workspace-wide instructions apply to all modes within the current project and can be defined using files:

*   **Preferred Method: Directory-Based (`.roo/rules/`)**
    *   Create a directory named `.roo/rules/` in your workspace root.
    *   Place instruction files (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`) inside. Roo Code reads files recursively, appending their content to the system prompt in **alphabetical order** based on filename.
    *   This method takes precedence if the directory exists and contains files.
*   **Fallback Method: File-Based (`.roorules`)**
    *   If `.roo/rules/` doesn't exist or is empty, Roo Code looks for a single `.roorules` file in the workspace root.
    *   If found, its content is loaded.

#### Mode-Specific Instructions

Mode-specific instructions can be set in two independent ways that can be used simultaneously:

1.  **Using the Prompts Tab:**

    <img src="/img/custom-instructions/custom-instructions-2.png" alt="Roo Code Prompts tab showing mode-specific custom instructions interface" width="600" />
    * **Open Tab:** Click the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar
    * **Select Mode:** Under the Modes heading, click the button for the mode you want to customize
    * **Enter Instructions:** Enter your instructions in the text area under "Mode-specific Custom Instructions (optional)"
    * **Save Changes:** Click "Done" to save your changes

        :::info Global Mode Rules
        If the mode itself is global (not workspace-specific), any custom instructions you set for it will also apply globally for that mode across all workspaces.
        :::

2.  **Using Rule Files/Directories:** Provide mode-specific instructions via files:
    *   **Preferred Method: Directory-Based (`.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/`)**
        *   Create a directory named `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/` (e.g., `.roo/rules-docs-writer/`) in your workspace root.
        *   Place instruction files inside (recursive loading). Files are read and appended to the system prompt in **alphabetical order** by filename.
        *   This method takes precedence over the fallback file method for the specific mode if the directory exists and contains files.
    *   **Fallback Method: File-Based (`.roorules-{modeSlug}`)**
        *   If `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/` doesn't exist or is empty, Roo Code looks for a single `.roorules-{modeSlug}` file (e.g., `.roorules-code`) in the workspace root.
        *   If found, its content is loaded for that mode.

Instructions from the Prompts tab, global rules, workspace rules, and mode-specific rules are all combined. See the section below for the exact order.

---

## How Instructions are Combined

Instructions are placed in the system prompt in this exact format:

```
====
USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

[Language Preference (if set)]

[Global Instructions (from Prompts Tab)]

[Mode-specific Instructions (from Prompts Tab for the current mode)]

Global Rules (from ~/.roo/):
[Contents of files in ~/.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/ (if directory exists and is not empty)]
[Contents of files in ~/.roo/rules/ (if directory exists and is not empty)]

Mode-Specific Instructions (from Files/Directories):
[Contents of files in .roo/rules-{modeSlug}/ (if directory exists and is not empty)]
[Contents of .roorules-{modeSlug} file (if .roo/rules-{modeSlug}/ does not exist or is empty, and file exists)]

Workspace-Wide Instructions (from Files/Directories):
[Contents of files in .roo/rules/ (if directory exists and is not empty)]
[Contents of .roorules file (if .roo/rules/ does not exist or is empty, and file exists)]

====
```

*Note: Global rules load first, followed by workspace rules that can override them. Mode-specific rules appear before general rules within each level, and directory-based rules take precedence over file-based fallbacks.*

---

## Rules about .rules files

* **File Location:** The preferred method uses directories within `.roo/` (`.roo/rules/` and `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/`). The fallback method uses single files (`.roorules` and `.roorules-{modeSlug}`) located directly in the workspace root.
* **Empty Files:** Empty or missing rule files are silently skipped
* **Source Headers:** Each rule file's contents are included with a header indicating its source
* **Rule Interaction:** Mode-specific rules complement global rules rather than replacing them

---

## Examples of Custom Instructions

* "Always use spaces for indentation, with a width of 4 spaces"
* "Use camelCase for variable names"
* "Write unit tests for all new functions"
* "Explain your reasoning before providing code"
* "Focus on code readability and maintainability"
* "Prioritize using the most common library in the community"
* "When adding new features to websites, ensure they are responsive and accessible"

:::tip Pro Tip: Team Standardization
For team environments, consider these approaches:

**Project Standards**: Use workspace `.roo/rules/` directories under version control to standardize Roo's behavior for specific projects. This ensures consistent code style and development workflows across team members.

**Organization Standards**: Use global rules (`~/.roo/rules/`) to establish organization-wide coding standards that apply to all projects. Team members can set up identical global rules for consistency across all work.

**Hybrid Approach**: Combine global rules for organization standards with project-specific workspace rules for project-specific requirements. Workspace rules can override global rules when needed.

The directory-based approach offers better organization than single `.roorules` files and supports both global and project-level customization.
