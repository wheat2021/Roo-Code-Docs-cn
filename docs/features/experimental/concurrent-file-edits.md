# Concurrent File Edits (AKA Multi-File Edits)

Edit multiple files in a single operation, dramatically speeding up refactoring and multi-file changes.

---

## What It Does

Concurrent File Edits allows Roo to modify multiple files in your workspace within a single request. Instead of approving each file edit individually, you review and approve all changes at once through a unified batch approval interface.

---

## Why Use It

**Traditional approach**: Sequential file edits requiring individual approvals
- Edit file A → Approve
- Edit file B → Approve  
- Edit file C → Approve

**With Concurrent File Edits**: All changes presented together
- Review all proposed changes across files A, B, and C
- Approve once to apply all changes

This reduces interruptions and speeds up complex tasks like:
- Refactoring functions across multiple files
- Updating configuration values throughout your codebase
- Renaming components and their references
- Applying consistent formatting or style changes

---

## How to Enable

:::info Experimental Feature
Multi-File Edits is an experimental feature and must be enabled in settings.

1. Open Roo Code settings (click the gear icon in Roo Code)
2. Navigate to **Roo Code > Experimental Settings**
3. Enable the **Enable multi-file edits** option

## Using the Feature

When enabled, Roo automatically uses concurrent edits when appropriate. You'll see a "Batch Diff Approval" interface showing:

- All files to be modified
- Proposed changes for each file
- Options to approve all changes or review individually

### Example Workflow

1. Ask Roo to "Update all API endpoints to use the new authentication method"
2. Roo analyzes your codebase and identifies all affected files
3. You receive a single batch approval request showing changes across:
   - `src/api/users.js`
   - `src/api/products.js`
   - `src/api/orders.js`
   - `src/middleware/auth.js`
4. Review all changes in the unified diff view
5. Approve to apply all changes simultaneously

## Technical Details

This feature leverages the [`apply_diff`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff#experimental-multi-file-edits-multi_file_apply_diff) tool's experimental multi-file capabilities. For detailed information about the implementation, XML format, and how the `MultiFileSearchReplaceDiffStrategy` works, see the [apply_diff documentation](/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff#experimental-multi-file-edits-multi_file_apply_diff).

## Best Practices

### When to Enable
- Using capable AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, etc.)
- Comfortable reviewing multiple changes at once

### When to Keep Disabled
- Working with less capable models that might struggle with complex multi-file contexts
- Prefer reviewing each change individually

---

## Limitations

- **Experimental**: This feature is still being refined and may have edge cases
- **Model dependent**: Works best with more capable AI models
- **Token usage**: Initial requests may use more tokens due to larger context
- **Complexity**: Very large batch operations might be harder to review

---

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Batching
- Verify the experimental flag is enabled in settings
- Check that your model supports multi-file operations
- Ensure files aren't restricted by `.rooignore`

### Approval UI Not Appearing
- Update to the latest version of Roo Code
- Check VS Code's output panel for errors
- Try disabling and re-enabling the feature

### Performance Issues
- For very large batches, consider breaking the task into smaller chunks
- Monitor token usage if working with limited API quotas
